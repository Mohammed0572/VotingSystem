## How the System Works

The voting process is divided into clear, secure stages to ensure the integrity of the election from start to finish.

### 1. Voter Registration

Before an election begins, eligible voters are registered into the system by the administration.

- The voter's facial biometric data is captured via webcam and securely encoded.
- Each voter is assigned a unique Voter ID linked to their biometric profile.

### 2. Secure Authentication (Face Recognition)

When a voter wants to cast their vote, they must pass a strict authentication process:

- The voter enters their unique Voter ID on the login page.
- The system activates the webcam to perform a live facial scan.
- The live scan is compared against the securely stored biometric data.
- If the face matches, the system verifies the voter's identity and grants them a secure, temporary session to access the voting booth. This prevents anyone from logging in with a stolen password.

### 3. The Voting Process (Blockchain)

Once inside the secure voting dashboard:

- The voter is presented with the list of participating candidates.
- The voter makes their selection and casts their vote.
- The vote is transmitted directly to a **Smart Contract** deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- The Smart Contract independently verifies that the voter has not already voted.
- Once verified, the vote is permanently recorded on the blockchain ledger.

### 4. Election Management (Admin Dashboard)

Administrators have access to a separate, secure dashboard where they can:

- Define the election parameters (Start Date and End Date).
- Add or manage the list of candidates.
- Monitor the ongoing election securely.

## Core Security Features

- **Facial Recognition Authentication:** You cannot vote using someone else's credentials. The system uses facial recognition to match the voter. _(Note: Active liveness detection/anti-spoofing is currently out of scope for this prototype)._
- **Immutability:** Because votes are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, they cannot be deleted, modified, or tampered with by anyone—not even the administrators.
- **No Single Point of Failure:** Unlike traditional centralized databases that can be hacked to alter vote counts, the decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures the voting data is distributed and secure.
- **Double-Voting Prevention:** The smart contract logic strictly enforces the rule that one person gets exactly one vote. Any attempt to vote twice is automatically rejected by the blockchain network.

## CodeQL Security Scan Status

The project utilizes GitHub's automated **CodeQL analysis** to continuously scan the codebase for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and compliance.

### Latest Scan Status
- **Status:** [![CodeQL](https://github.com/Mohammed0572/VotingSystem/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mohammed0572/VotingSystem/actions/workflows/codeql.yml) (Passing / Clean)
- **Coverage:** Scans both **JavaScript/TypeScript** (Frontend & Express App) and **Python** (FastAPI Authentication Server) codebases.
- **Trigger:** Automated analysis is performed on every push to the `main` branch, pull requests, and scheduled weekly (every Sunday at 01:30 UTC).

### Security Review Outcomes & Resolved Issues
In recent security remediation cycles, all identified vulnerabilities have been systematically resolved:

1. **Authentication Security & Secret Management**
   - **Remediation:** Split configuration secrets into unique client-side (`NODE_SECRET_KEY`) and server-side (`FASTAPI_SECRET_KEY`) JWT signing secrets.
   - **Production Hardening:** Integrated `envalid` to validate required environment variables at startup, disabling dangerous fallback defaults in production.
2. **Brute-Force & Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation**
   - **Rate Limiting:** Integrated `slowapi` (backed by Redis with an in-memory fallback for local dev) on the FastAPI face authentication endpoints. `/verify-face` is rate-limited to 5 requests per minute per IP, and `/enroll-face` is limited to 10 requests per minute per IP.
   - **Payload Size Guards:** Implemented strict request payload limits (maximum of 2MB per image sequence) to block memory-exhaustion DoS attacks.
3. **Input Sanitization & Injection Prevention**
   - **Form Field Safety:** Implemented strict `maxLength={64}` limits and disabled auto-completion on Login views.
   - **Regex Restraints:** Added paste listeners (`handlePaste`) to reject non-alphanumeric inputs or values exceeding length limits.
   - **Vote Integrity:** Enforced candidate verification checks on vote submissions in the frontend, preventing attempts to inject invalid candidate IDs.
   - **Unused Code Cleanup:** Completely removed the experimental MongoDB backend (`server/` directory) to reduce the attack surface and eliminate potential NoSQL injection vectors.
4. **Replay & Side-Channel Protections**
   - **Anti-Replay Nonces:** Added cryptographic random UUID nonces and timestamps to verification requests to block capture-and-replay exploitation.
   - **Information Disclosure Mitigation:** Removed the face-matching proximity `distance` score from the public `/verify-face` response payload to prevent side-channel reverse-engineering of user faces.
5. **Secure Headers & Strict CORS**
   - **Response Hardening:** Added middleware to both Express and FastAPI servers to set strict `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP), `Permissions-Policy` (camera enabled only for self, microphone/geolocation disabled), `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy` headers.
   - **Origin Restriction:** Configured CORS origins on the FastAPI server to strictly allow only the specified frontend origin.

### Outstanding Findings
- **None:** There are currently no outstanding security alerts or vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL.

## Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to download and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.10 recommended)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) (Local Ethereum blockchain)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/) (`npm install -g truffle`)
- Webcam (for facial recognition)

### 1. Download the Repository

You can either fork the repository on GitHub or download it directly to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammed0572/VotingSystem.git
cd VotingSystem
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the Node.js packages for the frontend using `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Install the Python packages for the Face Authentication API:

```bash
cd backend/face_auth
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../..
```

_(Note: The `face_recognition` Python library requires `dlib`, which may need CMake and a C++ compiler installed on your system.)_

### 3. Configure the Environment

Copy the example environment files and set them up:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/face_auth/.env.example backend/face_auth/.env
```

Generate two unique secure secret keys by running this command twice:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

Place one key as `NODE_SECRET_KEY` in the root `.env` file, and the other as `FASTAPI_SECRET_KEY` in `backend/face_auth/.env`.

### 4. Start the Blockchain (Ganache)

1. Open **Ganache** and create a new workspace (e.g., named "development").
2. Link it to the `blockchain/truffle-config.js` file in the project root.
3. Configure your **MetaMask** extension to connect to `http://localhost:7545` (Chain ID 1337) and import an account using one of Ganache's private keys.

### 5. Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts

Open a terminal in the root directory. You can deploy either to your local Ganache network or to the public Sepolia testnet.

**For Local Development (Ganache):**

```bash
cd blockchain
npx truffle compile
npx truffle migrate
```

**For Public Testnet (Sepolia):**
Ensure you have set the `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` (e.g., from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) or [Infura](https://infura.io)) and `MNEMONIC` in your `.env` file, and that your account has some Sepolia testnet ETH.

```bash
cd blockchain
npx truffle compile
npx truffle migrate --network sepolia
```

### 6. Build or Run the Frontend

The frontend uses Vite and React. You can either run the development server or build for production.

**For Development (Recommended):**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**For Production:**

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

### 7. Run the Servers

You need to run two servers simultaneously in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1: Start the Face Auth API**

```bash
cd backend/face_auth
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Server**
If you are using the development server, `npm run dev` is already running. If you built for production, ensure `npm run serve` is running.

### 8. Access the App

Open your web browser and go to:

- **http://localhost:5173** (if using `npm run dev`)
- **http://localhost:8080** (if using `npm run serve`)

## Testing

This project includes automated testing suites for the Smart Contracts, Backend API, and Frontend components.

### 1. Smart Contracts (Truffle)

The solidity smart contracts are tested using Truffle and Mocha/Chai. Ensure Ganache is running before executing the tests.

```bash
cd blockchain
npx truffle test
```

### 2. Backend API (pytest)

The FastAPI backend is tested using `pytest`. The tests mock the face recognition modules to run quickly without needing real webcam input.

```bash
cd backend/face_auth
pytest
```

### 3. Frontend (Vitest)

The React frontend components are tested using Vitest and React Testing Library.

```bash
npm run test
```
